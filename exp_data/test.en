We can discuss it now, right?
The court hearing is over, we can discuss it.
Yes, we can.
And we can curse in public, do whatever we want.
So everybody can go to the bathroom now, we'll get right to the point after that.
We need to spend more money.
on a better ballistic expert.
Please, can we?
I don't care about the expense.
I have only one kid.
I don't know if I should ask Bianca to testify.
Are you ready to interrogate Bianca?
I'm...ready.
It would made her sad.
Bianca and her mother wanna talk to us.
Oh my god.
Where's Kerry? We need to find him.
Why?
Only Kerry can talk to her.
Behave yourself and listen to daddy.
I'll see you tonight.
I can't take the children to school.
You are always the one who take the children to school.
I have to go to work early today.
Now? Isn't it too early?
It's not Juanita's fault.
Don't blame her.
You should blame her parents.
Poor Juanita.
Why is this shop out of power?
Sorry, sir.
It's okay.
Didn't you pay the electricity bill?
Have you found the safe box?
I can't wait.
Yes, I have.
And I've already opened it.
The Bible just gone with no trace.
Have the police check fingerprints in that parish.
I think we'll find out something.
But why would anyone wanna stole the Bible?
What happened to her?
Is she crying?
Yeah.
She drives me crazy.
I can handle everything except a crying woman.
Who's the woman asked him to drink?
I don't know her. I only know she's a journalist.
She followed John in the interview.
She wanted to ask him to do a follow-up story.
Here comes a luxury car.
Oh my god. The driver looks familiar.
Does he belong to us?
Yes, he's Sam.
Relax. He's nice.
Why are you so down? What happened?
I'm so bored.
I need to spend time with a pile of papers entire day.
Neil's checked all the informations of Duran.
He was unexpectedlly innocent.
Of course.
How can you doubt Duran?
He would never lie.
Maybe you're right.
I'm Nick, I wanna be your stockbroker.
I've already got a stockbroker.
Really? How's his work?
Has he made you money last year?
The economic crisis was in last year, nobody could make money.
What are you celebrating?
We've got few games left.
We have nothing to celebrate until next week.
We just want to have a relax.
I think our hard work deserves a little reward.
Is Jones there? I need him to do me a favor.
He's not here. What do you need from him?
Check the fingerprints on this for me.
See if we can find the owner of these fingerprints.
Okay, Jones's out. You can find him tomorrow.
Here's my search warrant.
Who are you looking for?
I want to find a dealer named Grace, 
who runs a upscale wine cellar.
I need to find her father through Grace.
I'm going to hold a private wine tasting party.
Can you invite your friends?
You can contact him directly.
My friend is a cautious person.
He'll come if you'd tell him more information in person.
No one's there. That jerk must have seen us.
The monitoring shows that he's fled the scene.
He's drove away just two minutes before we blocked the building.
So you have no idea where he is.
We're monitoring him through a traffic camera.
He didn't even have time to grab his noteook.
I need to talk to Ivy.
She hasn't talked to me since last time.
Sorry, Ivy's not been in a good mood recently. She's not in the mood of talking.
Even after winning the prize?
She won a big prize recently.
These things happen. So am I sometimes.
It's Ryan, do you know him?
Yeah, he owns a small factory which products children's toys.
The shopkeepers in the city often ask him for cooperation.
Has Neil ever cooperated with him?
Well, they tried to work together once.
Now Ryan and Neil are friends.
Any information from the head office?
Intelligence has got it.
What did they get?
The surveillance video of the restaurant.
Good job. It's probably Vix who found it.
Peter, why are you here?
I happened to go shopping nearby.
I just drop by and invite you to tomorrow's party.
By the way, is Jenny at home?
I'll invite her later.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
What happened to Jim?
He was caught cheating by his teacher in a test.
I can't believe that he cheated!
His grades've always been great.
Yeah, Jim lets his teacher down.
I've brought some oil paintings recently, I'll show you.
All of them are fake.
All? How did you know?
The real painting has a special security mark.
I‘ve heard it from a expert.
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time.
Look at you, you're grinning your head off.
Because it's a nice day.
Obviously, it's because that you've received a love letter.
Fine, but love letters do make people happy.
What happened to her recently?
Someone with bad intentions is looking for her.
Does she know who it is?
No, she doesn't, but they're powerful.
And they almost find her.
Is there anything we can do for her?
Wow, who painted this picture? It's amazing.
Justin.
Justin is terrific.
I'll find him if I need pictures in the future.
Yeah, me too.
We need an office in our new law firm.
Yes, I've been working on this recently.
Did you find it?
I'm looking for it.
But it's really hard to find it without a certification.
Jeffery, what's wrong with you?
What do you mean? Is there anything wrong with me?
I mean, why are you drunk driving?
It's dangerous, don't you know?
I'm not drunk.
You'll be arrested.
Do we have any plan for today?
How about playing cards? The weather today is not very nice.
Now?
Wait, Danny's not here.
He has a case to deal with.
How's Allie recently?
I don't know. She's not in my law firm anymore.
What? Why did she leave?
She opened her own law firm.
When is it?
About three weeks ago.
Do you know that Hayes died of a heart attack?
I know. But William said it's a murder.
How does he know that?
William's read Hayes' inspection reports,
which shows there were drug ingredients in his blood.
Peter, tell Andrew it's dinner time.
I'm afraid that Andrew won't eat.
What is wrong with him?
He's going to have dinner with his classmates tonight.
Okay, fine.
Continue the story you told me last time.
No problem, where were we last time?
The police issued an arrest warrant.
Oh, right.
Here comes the climax of the story.
We have a lot of works to do today.
Can we start it now?
Come on, first of all, you're responsible for collecting cases.
She consolidated the cases into a report.
Bind them and give them to me before getting off work.
Peter, how about having a cup of coffee?
Thanks, I don't need coffee now.
Come on, you'll need it later.
You might have to work overtime today.
Here is the emergency exit, there is only one entrance to the exhibition hall.
And there is a service channel.
Are you going to rob the museum?
How come?
If you're not going to rob the museum, why you have to know these things?
I just wanna hang out here next week.
Are you agent Jones? What a coincidence.
John, stop! Did you follow me here?
Hurry up, or I'll shoot you.
I'm here by the sense of my pants.
Hi, darling, how was your day?
No bad, I caught a bad guy.
Well, how about Jack?
Not good. He had an accident today.
Ah.
Hi, I'm Roland.
Are you here to identify the will?
Yeah, may I see the will?
They're on the desk.
Jones, I have something to ask you.
What is it?
Who's that girl?
Calm down, buddy. She is an icy beauty.
But I still wanna try.
The Pharmaceuticals company release a new drug recently.
Anyone in charge of research?
Jones.
Do we know any related information of the new drug?
We got everything we could. It's a new kind of antibiotic to treat infection.
Sounds promising.
When will the party start?
4:00 pm.
You need to get everything done.
The cake, the costume and everyting.
No problem, anything else?
And call all the guests.
Christie called.
She let me ask you and Susan,
if you are available for dinner on next weekend.
No problem. Why won't you come?
I have something to do.
Who's that girl?
Diana.
Did she work here before?
Yeah, she used to work in law.
And now she was brought here by her boss.
Jack wants to invite you to dinner.
Why?
Because you did him a favor on last auction.
He wants to pay you back by a nice meal.
Peter seems busy recently.
Yeah, he is courting a girl recently.
He is good,
but still need to work hard if he wants to go further.
Good luck to him.
What do you think of him?
He doesn't live a rich life. He has a resentment against the rich.
I think he has moral values, he often give donations.
Donations rationalize his crime.
And he is arrogant.
He doesn't know how to stay away troubles while he's about to be caught.
Why is the shop out of power?
Yeah, it's not the first time this week.
I guess they didn't pay the electricity bill.
What happened to him?
Is he crying?
Yeah.
He makes me nervous.
He's an adult.
Is John satisfied with his job?
Not really, he's too bored.
He needs to spend time with a pile of papers entire day.
Did Tom find the safe box?
I can't wait.
He got it.
It's already open.
I haven't seen Jimmy so happy for a long time.
Look at him. He can't even close his mouth.
Maybe it's because today is a nice day.
Because someone had written him a love letter.
Well, love letters do make people happy.
I was guilty of stealing the bible.
But why do you steal the bible?
I can't afford it.
Can you open this safe box?
Traditional safe boxes are not my strengths.
Learn to be more flexible. I'm not very good at picking locks.
I can only have a try. I'm not sure it'll work.
Can Jones handcuff him?
Give him more time.
I can't stand him any more.
Trust me, he's not a bad person.
He can still be corrected.
I hit the jackpot!
Really? How much did you win?
A million dollars!
Oh, my god. You're so lucky. Congratulations!
Now there is only one question: what am I going to do with that million dollars?
Look at my friend.
It looks a little familiar.
Does he look like Monsieur Dupont or not?
Oh! Yes!
I said I feel I have seen him somewhere before.
It's about time. Let's go!
Don't you need to pick Rustie up?
Is he ready?
He's been waiting for us.
Okay, let's go pick him up.
Does your daughter go this school, too?
My daughter is a senior now and I worry about her all the time.
Yeah, I always wondering what they're going to do next.
Your son makes you worry, doesn't he?
He is clever but impulsive.
Send your son here and he'll behave himself.
Don't run amuck in a Manhattan prep school.
I've lost a lot of money recently.
Where did the money use?
It's all in the stock market.
It'll definitely stand a loss recently. All the people are the same.
But I lost more than most people.
Let's go inside the stadium and have a look.
You seem to be in a good mood.
My dad took me to a game when I was eight,
that's when I decided I wanted to play for the Yankees.
Yeah, that's what all eight-year-olds think.
Neil, it's your turn, say something about yourself.
When did you come out?
I came out 18 months and 17 days ago.
I didn't count them on purpose.
I've never been in prison before, it seems not like something fun.
Do you know where Collins is?
I don't. I'll call my husband.
I'm sorry to trouble you, madam.
Got it. Collins has gone to my house.
Everyone is here already, isn't it?
Cook has not yet.
Must we wait for him to get in?
Yes, we need to act together.
Who has Cook's number, please call him hurry!
It's been a busy day and I still haven't hacked into their mainframe.
Have you tried asking Peter for help?
He did it for me privately last time,
and he almost lost his job.
Then it seems better to keep Peter out of the affair.
How did the police free Merrick?
It's for the long haul.
You look like you know something. Please tell me.
The sheriff had a plan. Take it easy.
What's your plan? I'll keep it a secret.
Neil suddenly couldn't open the web page.
Is he connected to the Internet?
He connects the hotel's wifi.
I can open the web page.
Let me ask the hotel staff for him.
Are you a friend of Neil's?
You could say that.
Can you get him to drop the charges for you?
He said I would send him a message if I needed help.
That's great.
I just got the results of facial recognition.
Who is he?
Anderson, he was a naval scout during the gulf war.
Now he was employed by some of the most prominent tech companies for private security.
Why did he hide his security identity?
Probably because of corporate espionage.
Get your papers in order, Neil.
It's due today.
No problem.
Can I help you?
No. I'd better do it myself.
I know how to set Peter free.
It's a waste of time. If there was a way, I would have found it.
There was a procurator watching, it's no use.
If I could trip up the prosecutor?
I don't believe you have that kind of influence.
I'm curious about some of your equipments.
You can't check them without a search warrant.
Do you have a supervisor to contact?
Certainly, I can call the supervisor.
That couldn't be better.
Did Jones come this morning?
He came early, in that little room.
In there?
Yes, that room is warmer.
Let me drive. You're in a huff.
I'm tired of sitting, we'd better walk there. 
We seem to be arriving early.
Just enough to catch him off guard.
It will make him more alert.
You're right, I've stolen a lot of things.
But I rarely keep things for myself.
Then you should have a try.
That will soon make you rich.
Hi, what are you doing sitting there?
I'm waiting for Hagen to get off work.
Does he work in the building across the street?
Yes.
What time does he finish work?
Another half hour.
How's Neal?
He looks hurt.
Has he learned his lesson?
It's hard to say, maybe he has.
Is it a good lesson?
We'll find out then.
This task is not easy.
How much time do we have?
Twenty-four hours.
We didn't have enough time to check it out to get ready for action.
Unless you go to a place where you've already gone.
Cuffy is climbing the tree again.
Don't worry, he's not a child anymore.
What is he doing up there?
There are other people here. It's fine.
It seems that Dietrick's flight was delayed.
He was getting off the plane with a man in sixties.
Sixties. Who do you think he is?
Maybe someone he knew on the plane.
Maybe a business partner.
Investigate who he is for me.
What happened?
Doesn't my blood tell the story?
It looks hurting.
Justice is worth any price.
I'll get you a band-aid to take care of the wound.
Amy said she was hungry. Is there anything to eat?
Can't she just eat out by herself?
Let me go out and buy some.
Why don't you order her a pizza or something?
Cheese or pepperoni?
Whatever.
Sir, what are we going to do next?
Investigate this train.
Why?
Do you really believe he's going to show up on a Halloween train,
and disappear into the air?
Did you hear about Mona?
I heard. She didn't catch the competition once a year.
what a pity. She prepared it for six months.
Don't you think someone's plotting against Mona?
You mean Lucas.
There's definitely something wrong with Lucas.
Come and wear this.
It will bring you good luck.
No, I can't accept this.
What if I lose it?
Then I'll lose you, too.
Ha, I'm just kidding.
Let me tell you something.
What happened?
The homework that Spencer handed in is awful.
He comes to class every morning with black eyes.
I noticed that, too. He may have been under a lot of pressure recently.
Come on. Can you concentrate on the College Entrance Examination which in a month?
This guy is here, can I focus?
Is Spencer bothering you?
He is reciting the words loudly.
I'll ask him to go to another room.
Good morning, Ian.
Good morning, would you like juice?
Why are you being so nice to me?
Didn't you buy me coffee last time?
What's the password for your personal account?
Do you need this? I'm not sure.
This is the bank's policy. Do you need to make a phone call?
Just a minute. I'll contact Jaime.
I wish I could talk to you and my friends.
Why?
I hope my friends can see your merits, too.
Why do you suddenly care what your friends think of me?
I hope they like you, too.
You let Mona go out alone, don't you afraid that Slat harass her?
Mona just goes out for shopping.
She will call me if she happens to run into Slat.
I'd rather you went with her together.
Don't you want to know the truth? We're going to avenge her.
It won't bring her back.
No matter what she won't come back.
We have to focus on protecting the people who are still alive.
Where's Hanna going?
She said she was having dinner with friends tonight.
How can she not answer my phone?
Maybe her phone is out of power.
Almost. But I did call her several times.
Spencer, we didn't finish our conversation last night.
I'm a little busy with my family. I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry if I bothered you.
I'm just a little upset.
I'll come to you again tomorrow.
He is not suitable for learning now.
But he has to go back to school.
Even if he did, he would be absent-minded.
We have to talk to his several teachers.
I already did.
I have't seen Emily for a long time.
She has been preparing for a competition recently.
Would she come to play at my house before the competition? She needs to relax.
It probably should be OK. She has no other arranges, either.
Dad wants me to be with Kate. What do you think?
I would say no.
Why do you say so?
Tom is very fond of you.
What are you talking about?
He's been waiting for you to come round.
Jackie asked me to tell you something.
Tell me what?
She threatened to destroy everything about you.
What else?
She said she was going to get her father to fire you.
That's why I broke up with Jackie all the time.
How could they do that? Who could stop them?
Stop! They won't listen.
Do they really think cops are stupid?
It'll know who's stupid when they get arrested.
We've been through so much together but you said something I shouldn't know.
What could I do can make you stay out of my business?
Tell me what happened the night you got home.
I told you I was set up by others.
How can I trust you when you say that.
Wait a second, are you leaving, too?
I hope to stay, too, but I have a date with Horton.
I thought you weren't familiar with him.
It wasn't before.
But who knows we became friends now.
Mr. McVeigh is an excellent ballistics expert.
But I think he's a little conservative.
Why do you say that?
He is good at analyzing the trajectory of guns but not 3D printed weapons.
Did you notice anything unusual?
That's right. Can I demonstrate it?
I have to admit I'm worried, but go ahead.
Electronic monitoring has recorded evidence of your crimes.
They have no legal force.
Why do they have no legal force?
The police officer will catch it.
Horton, tell me where exactly did Hanna go that night?
Well, why don't you just ask her?
Can't you just tell me?
She went to the bar with her classmates that night.
Where's Keller? I haven't seen him lately.
He went to Montague's on the weekend.
Did he go to visit his parents?
Yes.
Life is really hard.
Alison, why are you dressed like this?
Shoo, less noise.
What are you doing? Are you playing a game?
I can tell you but you must keep it a secret.
I was actually spying on someone.
Paige, do you need my help?
I'd love to, but I can't.
The boss will be angry if he sees me idle.
Doesn't he get annoyed when you chat with other people?
No, we're not chatting. We're talking business.
Hanna, is your mother here?
What can she do for you?
Please tell your mother to bring you to the police station for a blood test.
Why are you testing my blood?
There's new evidence in that case. The blood's the same type as yours.
Are you doubting me?
Do you remember when I helped you into the house?
I don't remember.
I helped you to your bed and then I went into the kitchen to get you some water.
And then?
You were gone when I got back to the room.
Spencer, do you think there are any clues in the room?
We shouldn't come in. It's not safe inside.
Now that we're in, just look for it.
What are we looking for?
A red coat.
How was it coming back from New York?
I'm tired of driving home. I should have taken the train.
How long has it been since you and Mona last saw each other?
Almost a month.
Take care of her more. She misses you so much.
Do you know there's a big news in town recently?
I don't know. I haven't been here lately.
Are you in Washington for the interview?
I was yesterday. I may go to San Francisco tomorrow.
How I envy you! Your life is so colorful!
You look a little uncomfortable. Do you need some painkillers?
What about hydrocodone?
No, I had a bad reaction to that.
It's not in your case.
I heard that the drug with a bad reaction.
Well, I'll talk to you when I get the results.
What did she say the other night when you met her?
She said she left New York and went back to Rose Town.
To see Wilden?
I don't know, she didn't tell me.
I know Hanna's worried about her mother.
But I'm gonna go check on Melissa just like she checked on us.
What are we going to check?
We must find out what Melissa did that day.
She won't let us find out.
Someone tried to kill Ellie and bury her in the backyard.
Then someone dug her up like a turnip.
Why didn't she just call the police?
Which policeman could she call?
Wilden or Garrett.
We have to let Ellie back.
What are you going to ask her?
I need to know what's going on? Why did she treat us like this?
Ellie has always liked to play games.
How? Is she kidding us?
Pera has these emails and she's going to release this report tomorrow.
How can I get the first publish?
We're gonna have to find some news tonight if we're gonna get ahead of her.
Mr. Polma, your sister Leah tried to kill herself a few years ago after a long struggle with drug addiction.
I know your family refused to help her in her last days.
What are you doing? Do you want to take a hit while we're not preparing?
No matter how hard we try, there is nothing we can do.
Any family dealing with addiction knows you've done your best.
How long do you want to play like this?
Rhyme? I'll have no problem playing all day.
I can see you're a smart girl with a quick mouth and fighting will.
But it's no use that you make me angry.
I got a tracking license.
I can track their cell phones and GPS signals from Spencer's car.
Good. When will we know where they are.
We'll know it in an hour.
Good, keep me informed.
Emily, my dad wouldn't let me go out for the night.
So what are you gonna do?
I have a few ideas.
Can you involve me in the plan?
I will help you.
Are you OK? What do you need?
I need to know that none of this is real, Shana isn't dead.
But all these are true.
No, she didn't.
Spencer, hi!
Eddie, we had not seen for a long time.
Thank you for coming out to see me, I hope I didn't interrupt your work.
I have a few minutes free.
Great. How have you been?
Not too bad.
Good morning, Shana.
Good morning. Is your father at home?
You just missed him.
Has he gone out yet?
He just left for work a few minutes ago. What can he do for you?
Something's really up.
Sarah, are you okay?
I'm OK now.
Think about what you'd like to eat tonight, I'll call for dinner.
Anything is OK as long as someone can deliver the food.
I'll never leave you alone.
Hi, Alison. I'm Lorenzo.
Haven't we met somewhere before?
I was in uniform when we first met.
Oh, I remember.
It's nice to come across an acquaintance here.
I'm new here, too.
God. Identify results turned out to be Alan.
Is that judge Allen?
No wonder he refused to sign a search warrant because he was a patient there, too.
Maybe he's the killer.
Would you like me to go with you?
No, I can go by myself.
I'm gonna hit the crack button.
Come on.
It doesn't look good.
Shawn planted a self-destruct program in the source code that will empty the memory whenever someone invades it.
Maybe I can repeal the instruction.
You should have made a backup before you started.
Jane, do you know who the father is?
Is that what you want to talk about to me?
I think you know it.
I didn't know it before and I don't know it now.
How can you not know whose child it is?
I hear Juliet's coming over here.
Yeah, she's supposed to be coming for the manuscript.
Have you confirmed the time of her arrival here?
Maybe she drives here, She wasn't on the passenger list on any of the flights.
What can I do for you? Sir.
Can I have dinner here?
Sure. Would you like a cup of coffee first?
OK, thank you.
Her preliminary analysis has come out.
Didn't she drown?
She is, but not sea drowning.
Is it soda?
Neither. What she inhaled was rain water.
Her autopsy report showed that she had drowned in the rain.
Which means the crime scene we're looking for has to have a whole bucket of rain.
We know the bodies were thrown into the sea in the harbor.
Yeah, maybe she was killed near the harbor.
Darling, did you work overtime again?
Yes, you're home, aren't you?
I just got home, I went to pick up the baby.
Why are you so early today?
School came out early because of an emergency.
He couldn't get away for it.
I dared to say that yesterday, but I'm not sure today.
Did you let him talk?
Yeah, he couldn't even stop.
I'm sorry. I should have give you a cup of tea.
What about the cookies on the desk?
I ate them all.
Even the chocolate?
I ate the chocolate first.
He has a low temperature. He must have been sitting here for a while.
That's today's newspaper.
He wouldn't be reading the stock pages while cutting his throat.
The edge of the wound is strange.
The whole thing is strange.
Did you see the man who stabbed her?
No, he's far away from me.
Was she conscious when you found her?
Yeah, she was moaning then.
When did she stop it?
Just a few minutes ago.
She's dead. She lost too much blood.
I ordered some nice dishes for you.
That's great.
That's purple cabbage. Nobody used to eat it in salad.
But it's a nice food now, right?
Can you quit coffee?
You have a family history of high cholesterol.
No.
You should go to the hospital.
You're so nosy.
I care about you.
I think I've triggered the power switch.
What if you release it now?
It's like a mine, if you've stepped on it, it'll explode if you life your foot.
We need a bomb disposal expert.
You should go, Frost.
Let's have dinner now.
Why don't we call Jonh?
No problem. Does he know the address?
I've already sent him.
John found a new job.
When?
I'm not sure. But he packed all his stuff.
Even our trophy.
He can't take the computer with him, can he?
Is Lucas your lawyer?
No. He's the lawyer at a law firm.
He worked on the Howell's case before.
Lucas is really a good lawyer.
Is Fritz okay?
The bullet hit his shoulder. He is undergoing surgery.
When can I talk to him?
Only when the doctor agrees.
Give me your hand, I have mosquito repellant here.
I don't need it.
Aren't these mosquitos buzzing your mind?
I'm immune to mosquitos.
Who's in charge of the on-site report.
Daniel. He just conducted a on-site survey.
Any discovery?
The victim was a white female, and she's probably a teenager.
Do you know her name?
There's no identification on the victim.
What do you do for entertainment usually?
I'm a fan of Red Sox.
I don't know much about baseball.
How can you not love Red Sox while live in this city?
Tell me about it.
Where's Nicole?
She went to catch Alice alone.
Have she caught her?
Not yet.
Alice is cunning. You should go help her.
What're you doing?
Alice's hiding. I'm trying to figure out where she's possibly hiding.
Any discoveries?
It seems that someone's been helping her.
Are you writing a book?
Yeah, I just finished a chapter.
Did you put me in the book? I can be a costar.
You'll be in the acknowledgement.
Fine. Anyway, don't make me an English man.
Their music director is suddenly ill.
For no reason? The show tomorrow is very important.
Maybe I can be their interim music director.
Only by one night?
I'll try.
Did you brought the coffee?
Yeah, I'll give it to my boss.
Do you know whether he likes tea of coffee?
As far as I know, he likes them all.
I heard Meilin opened a restaurant nearby.
Yes, it's Meilin's.
Have you ever eaten there?
Yeah, the dumplings there is great.
There's going to be an exhibition tomorrow. Are we going to see it?
What kind of exhibition?
The largest pink diamond exhibition in the world.
Didn't we see it somewhere before?
We saw it once last year in Paris.
Why is Leah crying?
She was ejected from the bakery.
How could that happen?
Leah stole a cake.
That makes sense.
Mom, I'm going to propose to Haley.
Not now. You're still a child.
Not now. Not then. When can I propose to her?
You can get married to her after her graduation.
Jenny hasn't seen Paddy since that incident.
What's Paddy got to do with it?
She felt humiliated by Patty's arrival.
She can only blame it on herself.
That's right.
Look at the girl in white.
The one next to John?
Yeah, why's she crying?
You need to ask John if he broke someone's heart.
Let's go and see.
What do you think of Anna?
I think she is easy-going.
Don't you think she's mysterious?
Is she from FBI?
Keep an eye on her recently.
Who's Neil's new love?
Tallinn Van der Sent
I've never heard of her.
She's a buyer from that gallary. She is pretty and nice.
You should encourage Neil if he has a crush on her.
I talked to the spy you sent.
My spy? What are you talking about?
Don't play the fool with me.
You think he's mine? I have never hired a spy.
Sorry, what's your name?
I'm McVeigh.
Oh god, what a unfortunate name.
Sorry, did I bother you?
No, I'll call you.
Cavry's girlfriend moved out yesterday.
What? She just left like this?
They have nothing in common.
Merry meet, marry part?
No, she had a fight with Cavry.
It's my honor to meet you.
Me, too. Jone.
Welcome to visit my house in the future.
In that case, don't blame me for my frequent visiting.
You're welcome.
I have to go. Matthew asked me go back to see him.
What happened to you?
Matthew blames me for not taking good care of his stuff.
Why? It's his own problem.
My job is to take care of these stuff while he's gone.
Why you broke up with Sla?
It was my mom.
Why?
My mom used to be mean to Sla, and she didn't allow me to date him.
Why didn't you come with him? You can only get freedom by yourself.
These clothes were found in the building. It's the same as the one Jones usually wears.
Looks like he did it.
It should be Jones. But how did he get out of the building?
Maybe he found a stuff elevator to the gate.
He is really something.
Hey, Will. Finally I found you.
How did you get here?
I got a lift from one of your men.
Where did you meet him?
At the gate of the hotel.
I did the radius screening and checked the traffic videos nearby.
Any discovery?
I found this.
It's the black car.
Yeah, we can keep on investigating by the plate number.
Honey, how about school?
Not bad. I'm starving. Can I have some cookies?
Don't you like my ham sandwich?
I'm not a fan of ham.
The Gallo is the best restaurant in the city. You'll see.
Let's go. I can't wait.
But I have something for you before leaving.
What is it?
It's a piece of jade.
Oh, it's so sweet. Thank you.
Why are you hangig out here?
Jack didn't answer my call.
I thought he went hiking with friends.
Yeah, I'm a little worried about him.
Don't worry, he'll call you when he reaches there.
Honey, did you have a great time in Grandmother's?
Yeah, grandma made a lot of yummy foods for me.
What did she give you?
She said that I couldn't tell you.
To ensure the security interest of the country, all meetings must be arranged by American Bar Council.
My friends from the council said they were busy.
But they'll arrange it for you in next spring if it's possible.
Thanks for your help. You are awesome.
Ha, it's my honor.
May I come in?
Only if your customer comes.
Okay, let me check.
My customer is a cautious person. It'll be much easier if you can give him the first-hand information.
I can give him a brief introduction.
Is it possible to arrest him?
Jones said he could, but in his own way.
I agree if Lason can be brought to justice.
But it must be legal.
I'll tell him.
The relationship between me and Aria has been hard.
I hope she didn't make our relationship worse.
I believe we can handle this calmly.
That's the best way.
So many works, how can I get them done?
I can get Jenny to help you.
Are you willing to get Jenny back?
If it helps.
I've been researching the video send by the arsonist.
Any discoveries?
The video has been modified.
What do you mean?
If I can get the raw data, I'll be able to find the location of the publisher.
Reyne gave me a dress.
Why don't you wear it?
It's an ugly dress.
Why don't you tell Reyne?
I don't want make him sad.
Mom, why you're here?
What are you doing here?
We're just playing cards.
Really? Why don't you play at home?
The tequila here is only 5 dollars.
Lena, we need to break up.
Why? I like you, and I know you like me, too.
Listen.
No, why couldn't we be together?
Because I'm not ready.
Do you know the girl in the picture?
It's my mom. What is she eating?
A hotdog.
No way.
Yeah, your mom used to love hotdogs.
But why doesn't she eat hotdogs anymore?
Because she's grown up.
What's this?
The Federal Law Enforcement Bureau wants your help. Neil escaped.
Why me?
Maybe because you're the only one who's ever caught him.
You would rather trust your broken tie than Neil?
The broken tie's never lied to me.
Why don't you believe that he's on the straight?
It's easy. It's not who he is.
You're too suspicious.
Hold on for a while, everything will be fine.
But what if Brie is found guilty?
I don't know. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Have you ever cared about him?
I don't want to argue with you anymore. It's late.
What did the kid say?
He still wouldn't say who bullied him. He just asked me to teach him how to fight.
But he's only 5 years old.
I don't want him to fight. But every boy would learn how to swing his fist sooner or later.
You know what? If you want him to win the advantage, you should teach him the capoeira.
The capo what?
It's a martial art dance from Brazil.
You look great in the FBI's coat.
Maybe you need to consider a new career.
No. I'll stick to my old job.
What are we looking for?
A tramp, who's probably related to the man who killed Paul.
You're born suspicious.
It's just occupational disease. I just like to be safe.
I know. But sometimes you need to take a chance.
Maybe.
Is everything ready?
Only your money left.
As far as I know, the security system of FED is unassailable.
Yeah, it's also the most unassailable security system in the world.
But you've taken 60 million dollars out of there.
That car looks familiar.
Yes, we met it when we came in.
We need to find out who they are.
Maybe a rival buyer of the chip.
Let's get closer and hear what they're saying.
Where's Bart?
He must have gone to buy the lottery again.
What would he do if he hit it?
The first thing he would do is to buy a roadster.
Is it the valentine's gift you received?
It's from Neil.
You look wonderful in this dress.
If only I could wear it on the runway tomorrow.
Maybe someday.
I need you to do something.
What?
I need you to get Chole's attention.
How's it possible? She treats me like I'm not exist.
You need to take the initiative.
Mr. Senator, I'm the special agent Peter.
Hi, Peter.
Thanks for your time.
How could I say no to the requests of the law-enforcing agence?
I have something to ask Mr. Senator.
Will, listen!
I know you've done your best.
There's no need to say this.
Let's have a dinner in a week.
Let's talk about it again later.
Now, go to your bedroom!
Are you ready?
Do you want to vote first?
Yes, that's a good idea.
And everyone here takes a note.
You have to examine your own conscience when you vote.
The young girl,
would she make a heartless killing？
Are you the leader here?
Yes. What's the problem?
The problem is that Mr. Anders is Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Diplomatic Courier's son.
So the Diplomatic immunity existed.
I wasn't here at that time.
Do you need any help?
No.
If you have any IT problems, please contact me instantly.
But not repair it without any minds yourself.
You've made an awful mess like this.
Do you want to stroll around the lake for coming across your ex-wives?
No, I'm looking for you.
Your colleagues said you'd be here.
How did the presidential election go?
Why are you asking? What have you heard?
You overthought it.
So you and Mr. Gordon were husband and wife?
Four years are good, eight years are ok, two years are bad.
I hope it doesn't make me unelectable.
I'm just here to ask some questions and not to evaluate.
So why did you break up？
That was written in the divorce agreement.
No, it just says "irreconcilable."
Yes. That's right.
I was thinking, Ms. Gobanza.
Who the hell are you working for?
Of course...The governor.
Then why are you hiding the truth?
You're actually here to probe
Peter's speech on Internet Business Taxation.
I...
I got a message.
Someone called my office anonymously,
who claiming that Peter took advantage of the governor's words to help you.
Can you tell me what happened on the night of the murder?
We were having a baccarat at that time.
Sorry, I don't understand.
⁣What is a baccarat?
⁣It is hold by the whole neighborhood down the street,
each family prepare a definite dish.
⁣That sounds interesting.
You can't have fun without cooking.
They skipped my house that night.
Please, I want to be alone.
You gotta tell me what happened.
I told you before.
I was desperate that time and now I started drinking again.
All my friends have deserted me.
But I didn't kill anyone.
You have to believe me.
I believe you.
I just hope the jury believes it, too.
David, come to check monthly, no arguments.
Got it, doctor.
But you really don't have to worry about me. I am very good.
I'll have an interview with you in a month.
Please tell me.
What am I supposed to say,
you will let me out.
David, you've been here for six months.
There's not the slightest improvement in your mental state.
I adjusted and I think I'm normal.
You weren't convicted because you volunteered to go to the hospital.
If I don't see you getting any better,
I'm not going to allow you to leave the hospital.
I have a stomachache.
Then you eat The Best.
Well, I'd better not.
At present, Helen has found out.
Those numbers are the serial numbers of the Best sample.
She was on her way to pick up the memo.
I was shocked that she was that kind of person
who wants results at all costs.
This bothers me a lot.
Sullivan knew she was researching the company.
And she must find out what he has hidden.
What do you know about Keller?
He is a good chess player.
He would make ten or even twelve moves in advance.
So everything they did:
they sent the helicopter, agents went from house to house...
He would predict.
they did not know his purpose.
Yes.
How close does it have to be for this thing to work?
A distress call from a submarine.
is designed to be passive,
which means we have to stand on the submarine
that it can detect it.
I hate to bring you and that thing
bumming around the East Coast.
If Alex knows as much as we think，
can she help us narrow down the search scope?
It's worth a try.
Have you ever heard of a double-edged sword?
That's the weapon you're holding right now.
What else do you know about this weapon, John?
What's special about this weapon?
It was eight years ago that Holt and I stole it for you.
In New York.
You're holding it in a wrong way.
Give it to me.
The upper part of the handle of the early double-edged knife should be 5 cm wide.
Grip it like this.
A better grip means a quicker swing,
a better control.
You're right.
Do you recognize this?
It's the work of William Blake, if I remembered correctly.
Judgment Day is very appropriate.
More like a rush to judgment day.
This painting is a forgery.
You have no proof that I faked this.
Not necessarily.
Why should I be so rash?
Because you're out of jail, I think.
Remember to resell it.
Earn a quick buck.
Are you saying I'm going to run?
William, I know when you occurred something hard to understand,
you would like to make up stories.
But you can't spit it out.
My feelings with Jack are real.
Your love are as real as his limp.
You forced me to expose you in public.
Do you see the bending marks on the edges?
I think he took it out of his wallet.
Why does he have a picture of me in his wallet?
I think there's an explanation.
The man holding you,
the ring,
Jamie is wearing the same ring today.
He knew you before you were five.
That's impossible.
Dear, is this the new car you bought?
I know it doesn't seem practical.
But Andre told me a lot about dying people.
I'm not unhappy
I'm not angry, this car is beautiful.
Just surprised you didn't buy a big car that's all
Do you know what LD50 is?
Mr. Sweeney.
It's called the half lethal dose.
Designed by Crexen-Brandt Company,
which used to test the toxicity of a drug.
If you poison less than half of the lab animals,
it's a sign of success.
Why do you suddenly care about animal experiments?
Can't I have compassion in my heart?
Peter wants me to cheat a widow.
There are two kinds of widows in the world.
The grief-stricken and the relief.
What kind did he let you play?
The kind that gets targeted for $50 million.
Is she Sophie Covington?
Is she a murderer?
No, she isn't.
Do you want to say after sitting?
I don't want to say it here. I hope you don't mind.
Now that you're here, just tell me.
I know this is old history.
But I need to clarify one thing.
I was really angry when I found that you were with my dad.
I broke into his office.
You don't have to recount the details of your glorious deeds.
I talked to your father this morning.
I vividly remember the threat he left on my voicemail.
Okay,
I'm very sorry.
Can you give me a glass of water? Thank you！
OK.
Maybe you should go out for a walk.
These pills will knock me out for a while.
You don't have to be here watching me drool while I sleep.
Clear your mind, and the spare keys are there.
I'll wash the dishes first,
and maybe the clothes next.
Really, I don't mind staying.
Did they introduce Residential ownership rate into the algorithm?
No, they considered doing so.
So what, they didn't do it.
Come on.
They talked about that in the design of security filters,
which introduced the residential ownership rate,
That is to say that it automatically puts poorer neighbourhoods at a disadvantage.
This is racism in disguise.
Yes, but again they didn't introduce it.
So it's not discrimination.
Let's leave it to the judge to decide.
Hey, everyone.
We are going to see the biggest banyan tree in the world.
Does anyone want to join us?
Who will eat all the mind to leave this fairyland
to take a sweltering ride just in order to see a tree.
One of the things I admire most about Cameron
is that he was as adventurous as I was.
We all like to do as the Romans do,
learn more about the local people.
It'll be all right.
We have to trust Jane can take care of herself.
Yes.
I remember when she was about five,
I looked out of the kitchen window,
she is climbing a small tree,
the small tree swayed even a bird in it.
What about later?
She fell from a height of three meters,
by the time I got to the back yard,
she was already chasing Frankie and Tommy around the house.
I'm sorry the security is so tedious.
Because we can't let visitors take any sensitive information with them.
I see.
You can go to the front desk when you leave.
Get your phone and laptop back.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I'm sorry we can't give you a gate card,
only regular employees can have.
The President's office is just around the corner.
I think in your unruly youth,
you should have stayed in countless hotels.
I seldom stay in one place.
What's different about this hotel?
It's an architecture at the height of the Renaissance,
there's also a jacuzzi and a hot stone massage.
If There is a next life I will settle there.
Perfect. Then why did you leave?
I got word that Europol was on their ways,
They think I did it in Corsica.
You can go back to school if you would like to.
The problem is I don't want to come back.
Is there anything you expect from a class reunion? I don't.
And I got a job.
Look.
They hire full-time workers.
I can learn from the best person.
Sweeney built half the houses in this town.
What do your parents think about it?
I do this just because of my family.
The sooner I make money the sooner I can get out of there.
Emily, have you finished packing your closet?
Still in finishing.
I'm thinking about what I don't take.
Baby we're not moving to the moon.
Just put them in the storage room.
Do you want to answer the phone?
It's Paige. I'll call her later.
How long did he stay in jail?
Three weeks.
What crime?
Possession of drugs.
Possession of grade B cocaine is a misdemeanor.
He was jailed here until he was released on $5,000 bail.
Looks like he's paying for it with his life.
There's about three liters of blood here.
It's a miracle he made it to the infirmary.
Because he is young and strong.
Okay, is here no cameras?
No cameras in the release area.
Well, you might reconsider it.
The first time we ate out,
you ask me what I'm up to.
And when the first time we kissed,
I realized I had nothing
except you.
Now I want to ask you if you would like to venture with me again,
Sarah Ellis, will you marry me?
Yes, I will.
Sorry, I have no purpose to interrupt you.
It doesn't matter.
I didn't expect to see you under such circumstances.
Have you been here before?
No. Never.
That looks good, what's that?
Boysenberries.
Maybe they are blackberries.
I don't know, either.
The waiter recommended it to me.
What's the matter?
I just found that my cousin, 23 years ago,
was born in a sanatorium,
the adoption process was completed here.
I don't know the sex but I know the name of the birth mother.
Can I get a copy of the adoption records?
No, you're neither an adoptee
nor his parents.
I know, but we don't know who the father is,
The mother is also missing.
I hope I can help you, too.
Actually you can give a hand.
Who is that?
David Sutton who is 35 years old.
He teaches science and driving in a high school.
What a cruel irony!
The driving teacher died in a hit-and-run.
When school just started,
the groundskeeper found him in the bushes.
What do you think? An accident or a murder?
I'm not sure. Frost, follow me.
I think he was hit here.
Take a photo.
Do you know these two men?
Should I know them?
They were
regulars at the neighborhood shelter.
If so, they probably go to Sea Urchins a lot.
Is it a bar?
Yes. It's where all the tramps go.
The bartender cashes their Social Security checks.
Sometimes they even let you take a shower there.
Ok. Thank you.
I haven't thought about Mary Drake for many years.
She is lovely.
What else can you tell us?
She lacks common sense and discriminability.
That's for sure.
How do you say that?
I used to be an accoucheur.
I've dealt with Mary's two children.
Did Matt's autopsy report come out yet?
Yes. I'm still waiting for the poison test and the microscopic report.
But I'm sure that
he did not die of natural causes.
Really?
That's an amazing discovery.
Why don't you two go to sleep?
There is a murder trial tomorrow morning.
We worry about that and can not fall asleep.
Don't worry, Bree is innocent.
The jury will understand that
they are mistaken.
Let's just say we're worried about Bree
but it doesn't help.
I've been wondering if we should stand out and help her.
Confess the truth to the judge.
I have the same thought as you.
Wait, Miss. You have to sign it.
I'm just leaving.
You sit there and drink a cup of coffee.
So you're a visitor.
What do you think this sign says?
All visitors must sign in.
Peter, I haven't asked him about the Welsh gold.
Why not ask?
Only the charge of arms trafficking
is enough to judge him for a while.
Decker signed a deal.
He'll try to get away with buying and selling guns,
gold coins can be used as our jetton.
All right.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
You made a public statement two years ago.
You're an atheist.
Are you still insisting that?
Do I think I am an atheist?
You insisted on saying yes at that time.
That does sound like me.
My life has changed a lot in the past few years.
You mean the affair of your husband?
Yes and everything else.
If you had asked me six years ago: what will I do today?
I'm not going to tell you that I'm running for state attorney.
Yes, life makes one humble.
I cringe at the thought of taking a flight.
What are you talking about? You've flown a lot.
Yes, it's only started from recent few years.
I think the reason why I feel nervous is that
maybe there are so many things I can't put down now.
What's wrong with you?
Catch your breath and do not think about your vacation.
The vacation hasn't started yet.
I mean, I don't think I'll be peaceful by then.
A pig roast, then a mountain climb and a show later.
Aren't you happy that we're all coming here with you?
It's just a little different from my original intention.
You can't leave without saying a word!
You can't do that again.
Especially after what happened last night.
I'm afraid he'll catch you,
or hurt you or even worse.
The picture in my mind was horribly real.
I'm in town, Spencer.
I'm right here.
But I didn't know you were here.
Your honor, they've found your party guilty four times before,
which makes that I was unable to reach an effective defense.
You know they're just playing tricks.
Objection!
That is a perfectly reasonable request, your honor.
She asked to check the SKU of the sweater.
What is the SKU?
Inventory components, your honor.
Every item will have an electronic logo on it
to prevent theft.
I'm surprised that you came back.
Why didn't you call me in advance?
I've been to your place.
Didn't Alicia tell you?
No.
We have a case for you.
Are you sure?
I think Alicia's worried about the money.
What's the price?
Increase the price by $20.
She said she wanted to confirm with you.
Three years ago, he was their school's
editor-in-chief of the school newspaper.
Among the staffs, there was a freshman named Penny Williams.
She committed suicide.
She had won the "Front-Runner" award,
which equivalent of the Nobel Prize for journalism.
Being a journalist is her dream.
I think he ruined her dream.
Don't you think that he killed her?
Yes, but I think her breakdown had something to do with him.
Because his position is threatened.
The rest of the staffs had 10 or 15 papers published but Penny had only two.
It's too few for a nationally recognized talent.
Yes, there is something's wrong.
Today is an important day.
I have saw it.
You're wearing your lucky tie.
Hey, did you find the Bible?
Yes, at the professor's.
Neil will go to buy it.
Then you have to give him money.
No wonder you wear your lucky tie.
No way. We're going to make a fake transfer.
Let's play cards!
I don't really want to play, mom.
Are you afraid to lose?
You haven't beaten me since I was in primary school.
I'm gonna take advantage of your weakness
to win a few times.
All right.
I talked to the fierce Kossack.
You've been leaking to the press about what's going on
of the murder investigation information.
This is likely to affect the investigation.
I didn't let any information out.
You used your work computer to send emails.
Oh, yes, I did.
I told my cousin something.
He has a crime blog, it was posted by him.
This is called leakage.
No, I just talked to my relatives about work.
Is that what you're going to defend?
Yeah, is that enough?
No, it isn't.
You're out of luck.
Why did that fool break up with you?
He said it was because I was too clingy.
But seriously speaking,
I think he wants to look for an older girl.
He is at university.
What about you?
We really didn't fit, so...
I might look like a mess now.
Is my mascara running down?
A little bit.
Can you help me erase it?
You used to work here, didn't you? Miss Frith.
Yes, as an intern two years ago.
Do you want to come back to work?
No.
Just a joke.
For warming up.
Well...What can we do for you?
It's very late. Are you waiting for someone?
Yes, Hughes. I have business to talk about.
What business calls for a personal visit from the boss?
An undercover police for decades. There is an organized crime and two murders.
It's not just involves Caffrey and his father.
This is public corruption.
We need to arrest Plath.
He has a lot of power.
I know that.
Do you have any plans?
I want to eavesdrop on him while he's in New York.
This must be hushed up.
I am is Nick Howden and I'd like to be your stockbroker.
I had an agent.
Really? How did he do?
Did he make any money for you last year?
Who made money last year?
No no.
If you hire me, you'll net three percent
after the crash.
I don't believe.
Then give me your email address.
I'll send you the earnings report.
Biotechnology and distillery stocks are up.
I'm going to divest Odeley from this project.
Are you sure?
Because once everything is ready,
it might make a fortune.
But things have changed.
What's wrong, Terry?
I'll deal with it.
It's necessary to check on Odeley.
I'll check the city plan.
If they don't discuss the project honorably,
it could be a breakthrough of our investigation.
Cameron, I'd like you to know my new friend Whitney.
Whitney, this is Cameron.
Hi! Nice to meet you.
Your dress is amazing.
This old thing?
Look at her haircut.
Oh my god!
Just like Barbra Streisand in "The Way We Were",
which is one of my favorites.
Honey, I was just about to call you!
I killed a litter of birds.
What?
My robot carried the bird's nest.
Now the mother bird is staring at me.
They can remember people's appearances.
I've seen it in documentaries.
Honey, I'm sure that it was an accident.
If we went to watch the game,
it wouldn't have happened such an accident.
I talked to your lawyer.
The judge denied bail.
How come?
You must be because of the mistakes I've made in the past,
so you got implicated.
Don't worry. Everything will be ok.
No, it won't, daddy.
I did it. I'm guilty.
Nate.
You never did anything wrong.
Caffrey came out of the E area's bathroom disguised as a guard.
Where did he get his uniform?
From an online uniform customization company.
He has a credit card.
He used my wife's American Express Card.
We're tracking this account and maybe he'll use it again.
He won't.
How did he get the key card of the gate?
We think that he refactored the public card.
He used the original record on the card. 
Vince.
Could you do me a favor?
Can you give this to Maura when you get back to the station?
Of course. What's up?
I just wanted to thank her for helping me study for the exam.
Did she help you?
She tried her best.
But I was hopeless.
I dropped out of the study group.
I'm sorry.
You don't seem happy because of it.
I'm really unhappy, I feel terrible.
Vega's car and search warrant didn't approve.
No jury indicted him.
What?
How could Merck prevent the investigation of a jury?
He told them to do it after the playoffs.
All the top brass told us to leave it alone.
Say that to Ron McKenna's son.
I didn't tell you to stop.
Try to catch Vega.
Jenna, what do you really want?
You can't give me what I want.
You and your friends are irresponsible.
Like Emily and I said,
you are not only irresponsible but also fond of destruction.
And you feel like you'll never have to pay a price.
We've gotten what we deserved with, Jenna.
We pay a price every day.
How much is the price?
Is anyone keeping an account?
I know you want to be compensated for your imbalance,
I can understand that,
but I won't let you turn this memorial into our struggle meeting.
Spencer, I beg you, please.
Let it go, stop!
You can't burn it.
I can deal with it in any ways I like in my place.
But this may be evidence.
I've already paid for Ian Thomas to be buried.
We don't need evidence anymore.
Please understand me.
Are you sure that you don't want a cookie?
No, thanks.
Ok.
I bought it for Sybil.
She's my favorite nurse. She is very nice.
I know how to repay kindness.
I suppose you were surprised to see me, don't you?
You are playing with fire.
You should come here to talk to me!
I just come here to see my friends.
It's been a year,  we still can't catch anything on her.
Can we subpoena her phone records?
All incoming calls go to the office voicemail.
So far we can't connect her to any other numbers.
She can also read others' minds.
I interrogated her a year ago.
She can read out something that my mother doesn't know in five minutes.
It's horrible.
We have to find her anyway,
or she could find us.
It's all right, Cary. Speaking slowly.
I know you want to tell us the truth.
I wasn't working for the state Attorney's Office at the time, that's the truth.
Before you worked at the state Attorney's office,
how much do you earn at the law firm?
Eighty-five thousand dollars a year.
How much are you making now?
Thirty-eight thousand dollars a year.
But you live in a luxurious apartment.
The rent is four thousand dollars a month.
A year's rent is higher than your salary.
Dr. Mora, May I trouble you
to take a look at these fingerprints?
They're in the van. Did you find them?
There are actually three of them.
You should have read the report, shouldn't you?
John Pork's fingerprints were on the tank lid.
Dunn's remains on top of the van.
There's an incomplete fingerprint on the rearview mirror.
It's probably the driver's.
Yes.
I think he might have a big company or something.
So he made me do a paternity test.
And signed an agreement that I won't sue him or anything.
That's too crazy.
Like I wanted his money.
Sign quickly! And leave on his yacht.
I still have to see him!
Why?
Because both must be present at the same time
so that the sample doesn't get swapped or anything.
I know you don't want to contact him,
but you have no choice.
Here's my contact information. Call me if you have something.
Thanks, Garrett.
Thanks to meeting you on the way.
Me, too.
By the way, if you want to have some fun,
don't forget me, a big idler.
Thanks, but I really have something to do.
That's ok. Get your things done first.
He died for excessive loss of blood.
Two stab wounds in the kidney.
It is an extremely painful way to die.
Yes, but it's fast. It only needs a sharp weapon.
Everybody uses it here.
No. It looks more like a prick.
The edges are clean.
It is something very sharp.
The same as Jane.
Tell me more in details.
Why do you think this is marketing.
We talked about that when we launched the first product.
Mr. Gross is about to launch something new.
He is new in the field of personal computing devices.
He invested $800 million for it.
How could he not keep an eye on the prototype?
In fact, if you're feeling stressed,
you can come and talk to me.
I know.
Sometimes I just forget.
I don't have to solve all the problems alone.
If you can't gossip with your friends at any time,
what do you need friends for?
I thought the point was that we could support each other.
That's fine, but it's fun to gossip!
Did you get the evidence?
It's more difficult than we thought.
I want to fingerprint Patrick's cup.
But he made it clean.
Are you sure?
Yes.
The comb is clean.
The toothbrush and razor have been cleaned.
Everything is spotless.
Either this guy's a freak with a clean freak,
or he had an excuse that he has to live without a trace.
I don't figure it out.
Are you suing the gun manufacturer?
No, we're suing the designer of the 3D gun.
The design defect resulted in my client's disability.
What does this have to do with you becoming a state attorney?
Actions speak louder than words.
I've been working on gun control cases like this for many years.
But in the same way you have acted many wicked men.
Like Lemond Bishop.
He's not our client anymore.
Will you never leave when you come back?
Thereby hangs a tale.
My mother gave up her custody.
That cannot be changed.
Leave it to the lawyer.
I should stay until the end of the school year.
And then?
I'll find out until that time.
If you can't take me in,
I could completely do something else.
Jay, Come with me to the mall.
No, I have a stomachache today.
That's a big deal.
Americans are squeamish.
In Colombia, something like a cold or a dislocated shoulder,
there's no need to go to the hospital.
Anna, can we have a talk?
Talk about what?
Talk about how my best friend and my brother cheated on me?
We're not lying to you. We just didn't tell you.
Is there a difference?
Do you know what hurts me most?
To hear Jesse say so many bad things about me.
You didn't say a word for me.
Good friends won't do that.
The goal is the vault on the eighth floor of The Reinhardt Building.
What's in there?
Gold coins.
They are made of Welsh gold.
It's worth three times the average gold.
That's all Wales is worth.
Choose other ways to make money.
No, that's what I want.
I'm in debt. This is part of the debt.
What do we know about the gunbearer?
His name is Grofner.
He is a 72-year-old retired engineer who lives alone without relatives.
Is he doing any drug therapy?
He doesn't trust doctors.
The last time he saw a doctor was six months ago in the emergency room.
Is he a mental breakdown?
Hip fracture.
The first emergency response team said they tried to talk to him,
but he said he only talked to policewomen.
Honey, why are you come back so early?
I quit, that guy was a complete pig.
He orders me like a servant,
totally disrespectful to me.
What a pity! You didn't deserve to be treated like that.
Exactly.
What are you going to do?
Run for state attorney.
Why?
I think I am qualified.
What about your own work as a lawyer?
I still follow it through the campaign trail on
the cases I have in hand now.
But if you win you have to quit.
Yes, I'll be the state attorney.
I only have a few minutes.
Let's get right to the point.
You want my money, don't you?
Yes.
Let me give you my reasons.
OK.
I will reduce the murder rate by aggressively cracking down on gun crime.
Good, it's really a big problem.
And I will work to double the process of prosecutions.
You said it!
But family
to someone like me is more important than anything else.
Do you know this man?
He's Eddie Rambo.
He works in Delari.
I interviewed him when I was drawing materials on the book.
Eddie Lamb?
Spencer talked to him today.
She said he wouldn't say anything.
He said it's against delarie's rules.
He may have changed his mind.
But why did he choose you but not Spencer?
I can't believe this is going to happen to me.
You can't give up hope.
My only hope is that you are safe.
This is the only promise I want you to make.
If things get worse I want you to find a way to leave.
What does "leave" mean?
Get away from here, leave here.
I want you to take a plane or a boat to
somewhere they can't find you.
I can handle it as long as you're safe.
I won't do it.
I want you to do it.
Promise me.
My God. Look! Maura.
There! There are horseshoe crabs！
Where is it?
It's over there！
Yeah, I saw one over there, too.
Horseshoe crabs have not been seen in Dorchester Bay for 25 years.
They come back!
Look! there's one over there, too!
Be careful! They are endangered species.
The first murder in the history of the Massachusetts Marathon happened just now.
It was a shooting accident.
Did we catch the murder?
No. Rizzoli and Dr. Ayers got there first.
Rizzoli got things under control.
Very good.
Although she is disgusting, she's a good cop.
It was lucky to have a medical examiner on the spot.
Ok.
So we're going to close the bridge.
You got what you wanted.
Today's task is done.
Don't frown, say cheese.
You take line 15 and go home.
Hold that bag with both hands.
The bus goes through a few unsafe blocks.
Aren't you going to drive me home?
You wasted time picking out belts that could have taken you home.
Well, I just can't accept it.
Our victims have a criminal record.
Why was she arrested?
They're basically misdemeanors.
Several times of drunken disturbances.
There was also a small charge of drug possession.
Both in Atlanta.
Doesn't she have a local one?
No.
I can't find her Boston address
or her work records from the state.
All right, call the Atlanta PD and see if we can find out more about her.
I remembered you said your mother was softening a little about us being together.
She's unfreezing.
What about your father?
How long will it take for the glacier to melt?
very slow.
That's why we call it the glacial epoch.
Do you know what that means?
That means we have to produce a little more heat.
I was arrested four months ago.
I was charged with first-degree murder.
My god!
I'm sorry.
It's the same case.
What do you mean by "the same case"?
The one in which you got me off.
They want to judge me again.
They can't do that.
You've been acquitted.
You're in big trouble!
Don't you think that I know it?
What should I do?
You'll get what you deserve.
Parking violations are second only to driving violations.
Driving offences can result in deprivation of driving privileges.
It's a privilege, not a right.
My God. Shut up!
Do you want to be a father?
I can't wait!
But I'm very picky when it comes to choosing a wife.
I hope my children will have a mother like my mother.
She's a teacher, isn't she?
Yeah, she is a high school math teacher.
She loves me very much and very strict.
It was my mother's blame
that guides the direction of my life.
Gloria, don't go. Listen to me.
OK, but you better not explain it to me
that this is an important client and you have a schedule to catch up.
Well, I need a minute to think about it.
I left Joe and went across the ocean,
which was not to see you at work.
You're not on vacation at all.
You're not the first wife to say that.
Then how many wives do you need to take it in?
This is kitt's plane bombing's
shopping invoice for the ingredients of the explosive.
It identified the buyer as Alan Burgess.
Do you know who he is?
It's Fowler's alias.
Diane found it when she tracked down his shopping records.
It was purchased a week before the bombing.
Fowler buys explosives and installs them on the plane.
What are you looking for?
Sober-up Liquid.
This will clear up hangovers, right?
My God. We just swept the place out!
Who drank the rum?
I'm to blame.
How much do you think these will cost?
Not much, I suppose.
Maybe a few hundred.
The hard drive is burned.
We can only recover one photograph of the farm.
It could be from a job advertisement.
The problem is we don't know if Brooks sent the advertisement.
He might be looking for a job.
OK, let's analyze this picture.
See if we can locate the farm.
Maybe it'll help us identify the killer.
The University of Washington is in the top 10.
Wait a minute, did you mention the University of Washington?
Yes.
Is it the one in Seattle, Washington?
Yes, I know it's not an ideal school.
What's not ideal is the location.
But this is the only school that offered me a scholarship.
Can we check Mary Biggsby's car records?
Is that Mary?
Probably she is.
I found it!
Mary Biggsby drove a blue pickup.
We have registered all the license plates here. We'll find them.
How long have you played baseball?
Me?
Yes.
Never.
Your shirt is great.
This one is waterproof.
A single layer of leather made of polyethylene fibers.
Light and comfortable.
Because it also has cooling properties.
When I wore it, I looked well.
I'm surprised that Ian will be able to run away with Melissa in no time.
Why did he kill himself?
Maybe he realized that he was going to be caught.
Even with Melissa's help,
he can't hide in his life.
Maybe he's cornered.
Whatever Ian does,
what matters now is that Ellie's killer is dead.
We're no longer suspects.
Why didn't I feel liberated?
What's your relationship with Helen Downey?
We are members of the same Witches Association.
I must get the names of the other nine.
What association?
Witches Association.
In the Middle Ages it was also called a convent.
It's made up of 13 witches.
